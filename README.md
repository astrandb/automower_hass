This integration uses the inofficial API, it is simple but it works. It is not officially supported by Husqvarna so it may be closed down anytime.

## Installation

This integration should be installed with HACS. It is not included in the official index so you will have to add this repository to Custom Repositories in HACS first.

## Manual Installation
If you prefer manual installation you will probablly not need any instructions.

## Configuration
Go to Configuration->Integrations in Home Assistant. Click the orange plus and add Automower and fill in the form.

## Known Problems and Limitations
HA will issue a warning during startup that I/O is done in event loop
